	Description:  Test the outcomes of the refactored tribute card playTribute();
	Business Requirements for Tribute:
		 1. The player to the left reveals then discards top 2 cards
		 2. For each differently named card:
		 		- Action: +2 actions
		 		- Treasure Card: +2 coins
		 		- Victory Card: +2 cards
	Test Conditions Identified and Expected End States:
					   LEFT PLAYER HAS
						 only have 1 or less cards in their discard/deck
							if (state->deckCount[nextPlayer] > 0)
							else if (state->discardCount[nextPlayer] > 0)
							else (no cards to reveal)
						 have more than 1 card in discard/deck
						 	if nothing in deck (move from discard, reshuffle deck)
							else pull from the deck
						 check for duplicates
						 has action
						 has treasure (may need to slip in a great_hall)
						 has victory

		CONDITION #1:  Left player has 1 or less cards in discard/deck - deckCount > 0
					   Left player has 1 or less cards in discard/deck - discardCount = 1
					   Left player has 1 or less cards in discard/deck - no cards
					   Left player has 2 or more cards in discard/deck - no deck cards
					   		- has duplicates at the backend
					   		- has a copper, has an estate
					   		- has a copper, has a great_hall
		CONDITION #2:  
					   
		CONDITION #3:  
					   
   	Known Bugs Inserted in Assignment 2:
		1. 	Within the duplicate tribute card check, removed the statement that set 
			the tributeRevealedCards[1] = -1.  This wll cause the player to receive
			double benefits even though they shouldn’t because the cards revealed were the same.

        2.  In the discardCard() statements for the nextPlayer removed the -1 for the deckCount 
        	index.  The value for the tribute cards will always be set outside the bounds of 
        	the nextPlayer’s hand
